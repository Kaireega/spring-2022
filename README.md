# Java Practice Projects

## Description

This repository contains a collection of Java programs and classes that focusing on data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and inheritance. The collection includes a range of topics such as stacks, queues, binary search trees (BSTs), singly linked lists, calculators, and practice exercises for inheritance and polymorphism.

## Table of Contents

## Object-Oriented Programming Practice

- **Animal.java**: Base class for inheritance demonstrating animal properties.
- **Bear.java / Fish.java**: Subclasses of `Animal.java` implementing different animal behaviors.
- **Empolyee.java / PersonalInfo.java / SchoolDriver.java / Student.java**: Classes practicing inheritance and object-oriented programming concepts.
- **Sellable.java**: Interface for sellable items, likely used in the `Amazon.java` or `Walmart.java` classes.
- **GenerBase.java / GenerInter.java**: Generic base class and interface examples showcasing Java generics.
  
## Miscellaneous Utilities

## Games

- **TicTacToe.java**: Implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java, allowing two players to play against each other.
  
## Inheritance Practice

- **Empolyee.java**: Practice class for employee inheritance.
- **PersonalInfo.java**: Demonstrates the use of inheritance in personal information.
- **SchoolDriver.java**: Driver class to test inheritance-based models.
- **Student.java**: Class for practicing student-related inheritance logic.

## Miscellaneous

- **TestStore.java**: Code related to a store system (possibly part of `Walmart.java` or `Amazon.java`).
- **Walmart.java**: Similar to `Amazon.java`, likely simulating store operations.
- **array.java**: General array practice class.
